## Server Status


Simple flask app with front end that provides ping updates for various servers.
<br />
To use, fork repo, replace ip address in flask app and Javascript list.
<br />
Run the flask app in development mode and every minute the online status will be updated in the flask app.
<br />
When the front end is loaded through a browser it will refresh every minute as well.
<br />
## Future Updates
Currently working on a text file system to store ping data persistently for future graphing usage <br />
Also working on adding port statuses through TCP handshakes
