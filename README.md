## Server Status

Simple flask app with front end that provides ping updates for various servers.
<br />
To use, fork repo, replace ips in text file, open a terminal in the directory and run pip install -r requirements.txt, you will also need to run NPM install to get the packages for the temperature reading.
<br /> 
The application can run without temperature input if you're just interested in getting internal ip connection logs
<br />
Run the flask 
<br />
When the front end is loaded through a browser it will refresh the page's content each minute
<br />
